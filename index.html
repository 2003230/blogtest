      <h2>Why are US Capitol Rioters being arrested months later?</h2>
      <p>Months after the storming of the US Capitol building by supporters of former President Donald Trump, authorities are still making arrests. The FBI has received more than 200,000 tips and is investigating thousands of individuals. So far, more than 400 people have been charged in connection with the events of 6 January.</p>
      <p>The speed at which people are being arrested has raised questions about the investigation process. Law enforcement agencies have been criticised for their handling of the riots, with some saying they were too lenient. However, the FBI has defend its actions, saying that the investigation is complex and takes time.</p>
      <p>The FBI has been going through hours of video footage, social media posts and other evidence to build its case. The agency says that many of the individuals involved used tactics to conceal their identities and make it difficult for investigators to identify them. This has slowed down the process of making arrests.</p>
      <p>The agency has also been working with state and local law enforcement agencies, as well as the Department of Justice, to build a strong case against those who participated in the riots. The FBI says that it is committed to bringing those responsible to justice and ensuring that they face the consequences of their actions.</p>
