        New York City's iconic Flatiron Building has been turned into a giant sundial to mark the arrival of spring. The triangular building was illuminated on Monday evening as part of the annual Equinox on the Flatiron event.

        The event, which has taken place every year since 1986, sees the building's triangular shape used as a projection screen to mark the moment the sun aligns with the street grid in Manhattan. This year, the building was illuminated with a yellow and orange design, which was inspired by the colours of a sunrise.

        The Flatiron Building, which is located at 175 Fifth Avenue, was completed in 1902 and is considered one of the city's most recognisable landmarks. It was originally built as an office building, but today it is used for a mix of commercial and residential purposes.
